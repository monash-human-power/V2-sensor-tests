# V2-sensor-tests

Teensy scripts to test if individual sensors work using the hardware debugger.

## Test Files

- [IMU + GPS Sensor Test](#IMU-+-GPS-Sensor-Test)

- [Reed Switch Test](#reed-switch-test)

- [Wheel RPM Logging](#wheel-rpm-logging)

## IMU + GPS Sensor Test

### Libraries

You will need the following libraries installed:

- SparkFun LSM6DS3 Breakout
- TinyGPS++ ([Download Link](http://arduiniana.org/libraries/tinygpsplus/))

### Common Problems

#### GPS module has no Red Light

GPS Module is not powered on properly. Your GPS module is probably broken.

#### IMU data values do not change

Your IMU is probably broken.

## Reed Switch Test

### Common Problems

#### No velocity or distance data
Check the following:

- Reed switch mount is close to the magnet located in the rear wheel
- RJ45 cable coupler is correctly connecting the two RJ45 cables together

## Wheel RPM Logging
Logs reed switch events to the serial port.
- Baud rate `115200`. The led on pin 13 will flash fast until a serial terminal is opened.
- Press send `'r'` to the teensy to reset it.
- Set `SEPARATOR` to `" "` for space separated values or to `","` for comma separated values (csv).
- See the notion page discussing this [here](https://www.notion.so/monashhumanpower/Converting-the-V2-DAS-for-wheel-speed-bf6dd023d1bb43e9b83206c37f624c6d).
- Each row contains:
  - Time since the teensy started.
  - The number of rotations since the teensy started.
  - The time it took for the last rotation.
  - The revolutions per minute for the last rotation.
- Data is sent and the LED toggled each time the magnet is brought near the switch.
- All times are in microseconds (Âµs).
